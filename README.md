# 🥊 UFC Fight Predictor - AI Model

This open-source project aims to predict the outcomes of UFC fights using Machine Learning. It includes:

- Data collection from past fights
- Feature engineering (fighter stats, history, etc.)
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forests, XGBoost)
- Evaluation and improvement
- Final predictions

Built using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and other AI tools.
